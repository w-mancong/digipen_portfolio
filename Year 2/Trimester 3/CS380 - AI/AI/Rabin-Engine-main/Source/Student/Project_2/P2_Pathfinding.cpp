        This is where you handle pathing requests, each request has several fields:

        start/goal - start and goal world positions
        path - where you will build the path upon completion, path should be
            start to goal, not goal to start
        heuristic - which heuristic calculation to use
        weight - the heuristic weight to be applied
        newRequest - whether this is the first request for this path, should generally
            be true, unless single step is on

        smoothing - whether to apply smoothing to the path
        rubberBanding - whether to apply rubber banding
        singleStep - whether to perform only a single A* step
        debugColoring - whether to color the grid based on the A* state:
            closed list nodes - yellow
            open list nodes - blue

            use terrain->set_color(row, col, Colors::YourColor);
            also it can be helpful to temporarily use other colors for specific states
            when you are testing your algorithms

        method - which algorithm to use: A*, Floyd-Warshall, JPS+, or goal bounding,
            will be A* generally, unless you implement extra credit features

        The return values are:
            PROCESSING - a path hasn't been found yet, should only be returned in
                single step mode until a path is found
            COMPLETE - a path to the goal was found and has been built in request.path
            IMPOSSIBLE - a path from start to goal does not exist, do not add start position to path
